# Takeaways for Week One

Judgements and evidence
  - KNOW: A judgement is a statement (proposition, utterance, enunciation). "claim"
  - KNOW: An evident judgement is a statement for which I have evidence (proof)

Rules
  - **BE ABLE TO: express what constitutes as evidence of a judgement in the form of rules**
  - BE ABLE TO: assemble rules into derivations that prove judgements
  - KNOW: Judgements above the line of a rule are called premises
  - KNOW: Judgements below the line of a rule are called conclusions
  - KNOW: Rules with no premises are called axioms.

Simultaneous generation of judgements
  - KNOW: judgements can be mutually defined using rules
  - BE ABLE TO: define rules that mutually define judgements and use them to assemble derivations

Derivable and admissible rules
  - KNOW: A rule is admissible if whenever we have a derivation of the premises, then we know we can construct a derivation of the conclusion.
  - BE ABLE TO: prove that a rule is admissible
  - KNOW: A rule is derivable if we can use a derivation of its premise as a building block in deriving its conclusion
  - BE ABLE TO: prove that a rule is admissible

Induction
  - UNDERSTAND: the principle of induction
  - BE ABLE TO: state the associated induction principle given a set of rules
  - **BE ABLE TO: prove something by induction!**

Simultaneous Induction
  - KNOW: induction can also be used for mutually defined judgements
  - BE ABLE TO: state the associated induction principle given a set of mutually defined rules
  - BE ABLE TO: prove something by simultaneous induction

Key:

KNOW = a fact that you have memorised / written down in a place you can find it again

UNDERSTAND = something you can explain to another, where you don't just know what, but why and how

BE ABLE TO = something you can replicate again on your own and without guidance
