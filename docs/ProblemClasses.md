# Problem Classes

For this unit we will hold **problem classes**. These will be your
opportunity to ask any questions about the course content.

For each problem class there will be an associated **problem sheet**. To do
well in this unit you are expected to attempt the questions on the problem
sheet - even if you don't manage to solve them. These will form the basis of
many discussions in the problem classes.

**WHERE:** Queen's Building 1.68 / [Teams "Virtual Problem Class"
channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a41cf0321b0a04cd7b4d2080653b2b93e%40thread.tacv2/Virtual%2520Problem%2520Class?groupId=68f87e2e-dfc5-48c2-b267-49f1769e1c29&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b)

You can decide how you attend, this just means that if you cannot come in for
any reason, you don't have to worry. (In the case that one of our TAs is
unavailable, only the virtual version will take place.)

**WHEN:** Fridays 11-12pm

**WHO:** Our TAs, Eddie and Sam, will be running the problem classes and
marking your work. They will alternate which of them runs which session
(physical or virtual), but will always mark the same people's sheets.

**HOW:**

You will have the opportunity to get your answers marked by a TA. At the
start of the year, you will be split into two groups: "Team Sam", whose
sheets will be emailed to and marked by Sam; and "Team Eddie", whose sheets
will be emailed to and marked by Eddie. To get your sheet marked, email it to
your assigned TA by **5pm on Monday**. They will then mark it by the Friday
problem class where it will be returned to you via the [Files facility on
Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/files/General?groupId=68f87e2e-dfc5-48c2-b267-49f1769e1c29&threadId=19%3AYLl8cZ1LVsO2bu8XXjE8QTc7WUPHgPZGzPmXUGdID-k1%40thread.tacv2&ctx=channel&context=Worksheet%2520Return&rootfolder=%252Fteams%252FUnitTeams-COMSM0066-2021-22-TB-1-A%252FShared%2520Documents%252FGeneral%252FWorksheet%2520Return).

NOTE:- since the class involves running through a sheet, our first proper class will be in week two (8th of October).
